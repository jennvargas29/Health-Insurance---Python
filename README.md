# Insurance-Prediction---Python



Objective: Predict insurance charges based on demographic and medical information, focusing on Body Mass Index (BMI) as a key variable.
- Dataset Attributes: Age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, region, and insurance charges.
- Supervised Learning Approach: Utilized supervised learning due to the presence of labeled data, where insurance charges served as the target variable alongside input features.
- Problem Statement: Understand the relationship between demographic/medical factors and their impact on insurance costs.
- Data Preprocessing: Included handling missing values, converting categorical variables to numerical representations, and conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Linear Regression Modeling: Chosen algorithm to model the relationship between independent variables and insurance charges.


âœ¨Model Performance:âœ¨
- Mean Squared Error: 33562118.81686984
- Root Mean Squared Error: 5793.282214502401
- R-squared: Explains about 78.4% of variance in insurance charges, indicating moderate predictive performance.
- Scatter Plot Analysis: Showed reasonable alignment between actual and predicted charges, suggesting captured underlying patterns, but also highlighted areas for improvement.
- Importance of Machine Learning: Emphasized the importance of utilizing machine learning techniques, particularly linear regression, in predicting insurance charges.
- Future Research Directions: Identified the need for further model refinement or exploration of alternative algorithms to enhance predictive accuracy and discover additional factors influencing insurance costs.



ðŸ“ŒConclusion:ðŸ“Œ
In summary, the project effectively utilized supervised learning, specifically linear regression, to predict insurance charges based on demographic and medical data, with BMI as a focal point. While the model exhibited moderate predictive performance, capturing about 78.4% of the variance in charges, there is room for enhancement. Further research avenues include refining the model, exploring alternative algorithms, and identifying additional factors influencing insurance costs, highlighting the importance of ongoing refinement in predictive analytics for the insurance industry.

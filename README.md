# Insurance-Prediction---Python



- Objective: Predict insurance charges based on demographic and medical information, focusing on Body Mass Index (BMI) as a key variable.
- Dataset Attributes: Age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, region, and insurance charges.
- Supervised Learning Approach: Utilized supervised learning due to the presence of labeled data, where insurance charges served as the target variable alongside input features.
- Problem Statement: Understand the relationship between demographic/medical factors and their impact on insurance costs.
- Data Preprocessing: Included handling missing values, converting categorical variables to numerical representations, and conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Linear Regression Modeling: Chosen algorithm to model the relationship between independent variables and insurance charges.

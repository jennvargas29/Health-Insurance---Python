# Analyzing Risk Factors for Health Insurance Costs in Python



📌Objective📌
- Predict insurance charges based on demographic and medical information, focusing on Body Mass Index (BMI) as a key variable.
-  Dataset Attributes: Age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, region, and insurance charges.
-  Supervised Learning Approach: Utilized supervised learning due to the presence of labeled data, where insurance charges served as the target variable alongside input features.
-  Problem Statement: Understand the relationship between demographic/medical factors and their impact on insurance costs.
-  Data Preprocessing: Included handling missing values, converting categorical variables to numerical representations, and conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA).
-  Linear Regression was the chosen algorithm to model the relationship between independent variables and insurance charges.


📌Model Performance: Predicting Insurance Charges:📌

-  The Linear Regression model was built to predict insurance charges using BMI, age, smoking status, number of children, and region as input features.
-  The model captured major trends well, showing that:

🔍 BMI contributes to higher costs, but its impact is amplified when combined with smoking and age.
- Example: A 25-year-old non-smoker with a BMI of 28 might have predicted charges around $5,000, while a 55-year-old smoker with a BMI of 28 could have predicted charges around $35,000.

-  Importance of Machine Learning: Emphasized the importance of utilizing machine learning techniques, particularly linear regression, in predicting insurance charges.
-  Future Research Directions: Identified the need for further model refinement or exploration of alternative algorithms to enhance predictive accuracy and discover additional factors influencing insurance costs.



📌Conclusion:📌
- In summary, the analysis successfully predicted insurance charges using demographic and medical data, confirming that BMI plays a role in determining costs. However, the results showed that BMI alone is not the strongest predictor—smoking status and age have a much greater impact. The linear regression model provided reasonable predictions, and the findings align with how real-world insurance pricing works. If more detailed health data (e.g., cholesterol levels, exercise habits) were available, we could further refine the model and improve its accuracy.

📌Recommendations:📌
- Insurance Company should:
-  Refine pricing models by incorporating additional health factors.
-  Offer personalized premium adjustments for smoking and BMI improvements.
-  Use predictive modeling (beyond linear regression) to estimate future costs.
-  Encourage healthier lifestyles through targeted discounts and policy recommendations.
